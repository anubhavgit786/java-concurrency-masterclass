### **Thread Pool Demo in Java**

This project demonstrates the use of various thread pools provided by the Java `java.util.concurrent` package. Thread pools manage a pool of worker threads, which execute submitted tasks. This approach optimizes resource utilization by reusing threads and helps manage concurrency efficiently.

---

### **Thread Pool Types**

Java provides several types of thread pools in the `Executors` utility class:

1. **SingleThreadExecutor**
   - **Description**: Creates a thread pool with a single thread. Tasks are executed sequentially in the order of submission.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for scenarios where tasks must be executed in a strict sequence.

2. **FixedThreadPool**
   - **Description**: Creates a thread pool with a fixed number of threads. Tasks are queued if all threads are busy.
   - **Use Case**: Useful when the number of threads needed is known and constant.

3. **CachedThreadPool**
   - **Description**: Creates a thread pool with potentially unlimited threads. Threads are reused if available, and new threads are created if needed.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for short-lived tasks or tasks with unpredictable submission rates.

4. **ScheduledThreadPool**
   - **Description**: Creates a thread pool for scheduling tasks with a delay or periodic execution.
   - **Use Case**: Useful for tasks requiring execution at fixed intervals or after a delay.

---

### **Code Explanation**

The provided code demonstrates the usage of all the above thread pool types:

1. **SingleThreadExecutor**
   - Executes 5 tasks sequentially. Each task prints the task ID and the thread name.

2. **FixedThreadPool**
   - Executes 6 tasks concurrently using a pool of 3 threads. Tasks may execute in parallel, depending on thread availability.

3. **CachedThreadPool**
   - Executes 5 tasks using a dynamically expanding thread pool. Threads are reused if available.

4. **ScheduledThreadPool**
   - Schedules two tasks:
     - One executes after a delay of 3 seconds.
     - Another executes repeatedly with an initial delay of 2 seconds and a period of 5 seconds.

### **Code Walkthrough**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class ThreadPoolDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Single-threaded pool
        ExecutorService singleThreadPool = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

        // Fixed thread pool with 3 threads
        ExecutorService fixedThreadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        // Cached thread pool
        ExecutorService cacheThreadPool = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();

        // Scheduled thread pool with 2 threads
        ScheduledExecutorService scheduledThreadPool = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2);

        // SingleThreadExecutor: Submit 5 tasks
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            int taskId = i;
            singleThreadPool.execute(() -> 
                System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " executed by: " + Thread.currentThread().getName())
            );
        }

        // FixedThreadPool: Submit 6 tasks
        for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
            int taskId = i;
            fixedThreadPool.execute(() -> 
                System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " executed by: " + Thread.currentThread().getName())
            );
        }

        // CachedThreadPool: Submit 5 tasks
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            int taskId = i;
            cacheThreadPool.execute(() -> 
                System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " executed by: " + Thread.currentThread().getName())
            );
        }

        // ScheduledThreadPool: Schedule tasks
        Runnable task = () -> System.out.println("Task executed by: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());

        // Execute task after 3 seconds delay
        scheduledThreadPool.schedule(task, 3, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

        // Execute task periodically (initial delay: 2 seconds, period: 5 seconds)
        scheduledThreadPool.scheduleAtFixedRate(task, 2, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

        // Shutdown all thread pools
        singleThreadPool.shutdown();
        fixedThreadPool.shutdown();
        cacheThreadPool.shutdown();
        scheduledThreadPool.shutdown();
    }
}
```
